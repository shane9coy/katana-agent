Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use,
copy, modify, merge, and distribute the Software, subject to the following
conditions:

1. ATTRIBUTION REQUIRED
   All copies, forks, or derivative works must retain this license file,
   the original copyright notice, and visible attribution to the original
   author (Shane Swrld / Katana Agent) in any README, documentation, or
   about page.

2. NON-COMMERCIAL USE
   The Software may be used freely for personal, educational, research,
   and non-commercial purposes without restriction.

3. COMMERCIAL USE
   If the Software, or any substantial portion or derivative of it, is
   incorporated into a product or service that generates revenue (including
   but not limited to SaaS products, paid tools, consulting services, or
   commercial distributions), the following applies:

   a. You must notify the original author in writing prior to commercial
      use (contact: github.com/shane9coy).

   b. A revenue-sharing agreement must be established with the original
      author. The default terms are 5% of gross revenue attributable to
      the Software, unless a different arrangement is agreed upon in
      writing.

   c. If your total annual revenue from the product incorporating this
      Software is under $1,000 USD, the revenue-sharing requirement is
      waived, but attribution is still required.

4. NO RESALE
   You may not sell, sublicense, or redistribute the Software as a
   standalone product (i.e., repackaging and selling it as-is or with
   trivial modifications). Building on top of it is fine — selling a
   copy of it is not.

5. CONTRIBUTIONS
   Any contributions submitted to the original repository (via pull
   request or otherwise) are licensed under the same terms and become
   part of the original project.

6. NO WARRANTY
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
   IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
   CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
   TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
   SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
